     <h1>MAHATMA GANDHI JI</h1>
     <h2>Monhandas Karamchand Gandhi was born in the small town of Porbandar, on the west coast of India, on October 2 1869.</h2>
    <p>He belonged by birth to the Vaishya, or trading caste. His father died when he was 15 years old, and apart from that time, his mother became the greatest influence in his life. Her spiritual teacher was a Jain devotee. Among the Jains in India the central doctrine is the "sanctity of all life," or Ahimsa, which is often translated as "non-violence." This teaching remained paramount with Gandhi.</p>
